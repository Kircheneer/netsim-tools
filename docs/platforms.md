## Supported Virtualization Providers

Virtualization providers supported by **config-generate**:

* [Vagrant VirtualBox provider](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/virtualbox)
* [Containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/) (added in release 0.5)

Details of VirtualBox and Containerlab support are described below, for extensive vagrant-libvirt details please [refer to the installation guide](install.html#building-a-libvirt-based-lab).

### Vagrant with VirtualBox

* Most networking vendors don't ship Vagrant boxes, and I had no interest in building VirtualBox boxes from scratch after setting up a *libvirt*-based lab on an Intel NUC. The only boxes I could get with zero hassle were Cisco Nexus 9300v and Arista vEOS, and they both work fine. If you want to add other devices, you'll have to modify *topology-defaults.yml* file.
* The latest version of Arista vEOS available as Vagrant box for VirtualBox is 4.21.14M.
* Vagrantfile created by **create-topology** sets up port forwarding for SSH (22), HTTP (80) and NETCONF (830), but the corresponding Ansible inventory contains only **ansible_port** (SSH). You could edit the final inventory by hand, add extra file to `host_vars`, or fix my code. Should you decide to do the latter, please contact me in advance to discuss the necessary data structures.

### Containerlab

* The only devices currently supported are Arista cEOS and FRR
* Feel free to extend the templates and defaults to support other network devices
