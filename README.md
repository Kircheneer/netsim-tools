# Overview

I'm building my network simulation environments with Vagrant using libvirt plugin on a Ubuntu 20.04 system... and I always hated how boring it was to set up a new topology and initial device configurations. The tools in this repository should make that task easier, and you're most welcome to submit pull requests adding support for other environments or platforms.

Latest release: 0.2 (read [upgrade warning](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release.html))
Stable release: [0.11](https://github.com/ipspace/netsim-tools/releases/tag/release_0.11)

## An overview of tools:

**create-topology**
: Creates a full-blown network topology, Vagrantfile and Ansible inventory from a simple list of nodes and links. [More details](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**config.ansible**
: Applies Jinja2 configuration template to network devices

**initial-config.ansible**
: Using topology data generated by **create-topology** and default device configuration templates configures common device parameters, protocols that should have been enabled (LLDP), enables interfaces, and configures IP addresses on interfaces.

**display-neighbors.ansible**
: Using Ansible fact gathering collect device neighbor data (usually LLDP neighbors) and displays them. Use YAML Ansible output callback for maximum readability.

**connect.sh**
: SSH to a network using device names, management network IP addresses (**ansible_host**) and username/passwords from Ansible inventory. Ideal when you use centralized Vagrant environments and want to connect to the devices while being in playbook development directory.

## Libvirt-specific tools

**enable-lldp.sh**
: Given libvirt network name, change group_fwd_mask for the corresponding Linux bridge to enable LLDP passthrough across the Linux bridge.
