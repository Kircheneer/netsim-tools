# Overview

I'm building my network simulation environments with Vagrant using libvirt plugin on a Ubuntu 20.04 system... and I always hated how boring it was to set up a new topology and initial device configurations. The tools in this repository should make that task easier, and you're most welcome to submit pull requests adding support for other environments or platforms.

* Latest release: [release_0.6.1](https://github.com/ipspace/netsim-tools/releases/tag/release_0.6.1) (read [release notes](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release/0.6.html))
* If you find bugs in release 0.6, please report them and use [release_0.5](https://github.com/ipspace/netsim-tools/releases/tag/release_0.5) (read [release notes](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release/0.5.html))

## An overview of tools:

**create-topology**
: Creates a full-blown network topology, Vagrantfile and Ansible inventory from a simple list of nodes and links. [More details](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create-topology.html)

**config.ansible**
: Applies Jinja2 configuration templates to network devices. 

**initial-config.ansible**
: Using topology data generated by **create-topology** and default device configuration templates configures common device parameters, protocols that should have been enabled (LLDP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, SR-MPLS), enables interfaces, and configures IP addresses on interfaces. [More details](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configs.html)

**create-config.ansible**
: Ansible playbook that creates devices configuration snippets (including configuration module snippets) without deploying them on network devices.

**collect-configs.ansible**
: Using Ansible fact gathering or other device-specific Ansible modules, collects device configurations and saves them in specified directory (default: **config**).

**display-neighbors.ansible**
: Using Ansible fact gathering collect device neighbor data (usually LLDP neighbors) and displays them. Use YAML Ansible output callback for maximum readability.

**connect.sh**
: Use SSH or **docker exec** to connect to a lab device using device names, management network IP addresses (**ansible_host**), SSH port, and username/passwords from Ansible inventory. Ideal when you use centralized Vagrant environments and want to connect to the devices while being in playbook development directory.

## Libvirt-specific tools

**enable-lldp.sh**
: Given libvirt network name, change group_fwd_mask for the corresponding Linux bridge to enable LLDP passthrough across the Linux bridge.
